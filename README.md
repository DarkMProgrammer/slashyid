### Hi there. I'm Slashy 👋

I'm 18 years old and I'm from Indonesia. I'm a hobbyist who loves networking since I was in my Vocational High School

**I can do and know...**
- MikroTik
- Linux Server (Mainly Debian-based one)
- A little bit of dynamic routing (BGP, OSPF, RIP, etc)
- A little bit of Python 🐍

My goal is to become a professional network engineer. I'm currently still learning about dynamic routing and MPLS

I'm currently work at [@bebasid](https://bebasid.com) as a staff who manage its DNS Server that you can [learn here](https://dns.bebasid.com).

**Note: I'm not currently ready to be hired because I need to learn more about networking dynamic routing protocol like I mentioned above but If you still wanted to contact me, feel free to drop me an email at [ slashy(at)bebasid.com ]**
