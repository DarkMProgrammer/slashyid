### Hi there. I'm Slashy 👋

I'm 17 years old from Indonesia. I'm a hobbyist who love networking since I was in my Vocational High School

**I can do..**
- MikroTik
- Linux Server (Mainly Debian-based one)
- A little bit of dynamic routing (BGP, OSPF, RIP, etc)
- A little bit of Python 🐍

I'm currently work at [@bebasid](https://bebasid.com) as a staff who manage its DNS Server that you can [learn here](https://dns.bebasid.com)
